# minecraft-lalo5s-addon

> Experimental fabric mod

## About

I consider this as a playground mod for the powerful [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) modloader. I won't work on this regularily or support every version of Minecraft/Fabric. Think of it as a playground where I test stuff that I want to have in the game.

I provisionally called this `lalo5's addon` because my username is indeed `lalo5` and I don't want to think of a more meaningful name right now.

## Feature list

A complete overview of additions, changes and all other stuff this mod brings, [the wiki](https://github.com/axelrindle/minecraft-lalo5s-addon/wiki) is the place where all of that is documented.

## Will there be a Forge port?

Right now I will say **no**. While Forge is probably the most popular modloader / modding platform for Minecraft, I want to focus on Fabric with this project as I'm a total newbie to that modloader and want to explore all the possibilites it has to offer.

But who knows what the future will bring...
